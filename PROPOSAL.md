# PROJECT PROPOSAL 

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND MOTIVATION:
This project will be a display of myself and my work here at BCCA. It will be a portfolio portraying my skills, projects, and information about me as an individual. My portfolio will walk through a path. It will start off with a picture of me and my bio with a button to click to move forward. Then, it will take us to a page with my skills and overall bio. Scrolling down, it will take me to a page with my projects and links to them. Lastly, there will be a small bar with my contact information on it. I am creating this portfolio to show a visually pleasing and easy access display of myself as a candidate to future employers and just anyone in general. 

## PRIOR ART
I have gotten inspiration of my first page through Nad Chishtie's personal portfolio. I liked the way it gives an introduction and shows a subtle picture (nad.is). I am also using another website's idea that let's me hover over the gallery of images to show a link. 

## CORE USER WORFKLOWS
The user should be able to view a page with an image of myself, a short description, a button, and my name at first. Once, you click on the button, it scrolls down to the next part. The next part shows the user a bigger bio (professional bio) of myself and my skills set. Once you scroll down, the suer should see a gallery of my projects with a description of each. Lastly, the user should see a smaller bar of contact information. 

## TUESDAY-THURSDAY DAILY GOALS
Tuesday: Have all the information laid down on the website in html. Start on CSS for the welcome page. 
Wednesday:  Finish Styling with bootstrap and css for the rest of the pages. 
Thursday: Add media queries and clean up/ fix any problems.
