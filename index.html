    <div id="bigger bio">
        <p>As a friendly, hard-working, and goal-oriented individual, I have come to learn through various experiences that I am driven to finding solutions to problems. 
            I am determined to find a solution to all problems that present themselves to me. Whether that be with utilizing help from my peers or doing it alone, I 
            always need to find those answers. My actions are guided by the answers I seek. Through my sense of initiative, I accomplish whatever task needs to be done. 
            Ever since I was a kid, my favorite hobby doodling every idea that came to mind. Being creative with paper and pencil comes naturally to me. I have developed 
            this hobby and drive of mine into the world of software development. With my skills in Python, HTML, CSS, Adobe Illustrator, and Photoshop, I am eager to 
            learn more concepts that will give me progress for future endeavors. </p>
