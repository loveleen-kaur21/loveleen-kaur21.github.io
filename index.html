        <p>As a friendly, hard-working, and goal-oriented individual, I have come to learn through various experiences
          that I am driven to finding solutions to problems. I am determined to find a solution to all problems that present 
          themselves to me. Whether that be with utilizing help from my peers or doing it alone, I always need to find those answers. 
          My actions are guided by the answers I seek. Through my sense of initiative, I accomplish whatever task needs to be done. 
          Ever since I was a kid, my favorite hobby doodling every idea that came to mind. Being creative with paper and pencil comes 
          naturally to me. I have developed this hobby and drive of mine into the world of software development. I am also fluent in the languages
          of Punjabi, Hindi, and English. With my skills in Python, Bootstrap, SQL, HTML, CSS, Adobe Illustrator, and Photoshop, I am eager to learn more concepts that will give me progress for future endeavors. </p>
